      Hi there. You seem to be using an outdated browser or have JavaScript
      disabled. As this is a JavaScript library demo, I would recommend to
      enable JavaScript, or you will not be able to see the demo. See, that's
      the thing with JavaScript libraries. It's like that Bill Withers song,
      "Ain't no sunshine when [JavaScript's] gone."
